Venues in Who's On First.

## Really Important

_This is still wet-paint._ 

You are welcome to poke around but please understand that we are in the process of working out the initial kinks.

## Important

_There is no data in this repository._

This respository is a starting point for venue data in Who's On First. All of the actual data has been stored in per-country (and in some case per country-region) repositories.

Details for the various repositories that contain WOF data are availible in human-readable and machine-readable forms through the [DATA.md](DATA.md) and [data.json](data.json) files.

Also, it's probably worth having a quick read of the [whosonfirst-data versus whosonfirst-data-SOMETHING repositories](https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/data/#github-repos) documentation.
